# NYC Airbnb: EDA&PricePrediction
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. The dataset includes details about various listings in New York, such as location, property type, availability, reviews, and more. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a listing based on these attributes. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  [**New York City Airbnb Open Data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). Additionally for the purposes of this project [Borough Boundaries Data by NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm) was used.
